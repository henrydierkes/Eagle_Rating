# Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the APIs available in the backend of the Eagle Rating application. It consists of three main API sets: User APIs, Place APIs, and Rating APIs. Each API set handles a different aspect of the application's functionality. Below is a brief introduction to each section:

## User APIs

The `user.md` file contains the documentation for the User APIs. These APIs allow you to manage user-related operations within the application. The operations include creating new users, retrieving user details, updating user information, and deleting users.

## Rating APIs

The `rating.md` file covers the documentation for the Rating APIs. These APIs allow you to manage rating-related operations within the application. The operations include creating new ratings, retrieving rating details, updating ratings, and deleting ratings. Additionally, the APIs handle filtering, liking, and checking whether a user has rated a specific place.
